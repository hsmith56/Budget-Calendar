##  TODO
### Need to clarify what daily spending is tracking.
- Is it tracking total spent on that day?
- Is it tracking misc spending?
- Is it tracking some categories but not all?

- [x] Confirm that correct values are propegated through month
- [x] Need a good way to carry over balance from 1st of month to last of month
- [x] more efficient methods of propegating balance forward
- [ ] Move Savings goals into seperate class
	- [ ] Savings goals should be persistent across months from start date to finish date
	- [ ] Savings goals should be customizable with start/end date, name, auto deposit on specific day
- [ ] Modify handling of paychecks (Do I set paycheck balance at first of month or as I get them?)
- [ ] Better input handler/input handler function\
