Need a good way to carry over balance from 1st of month to last of month

Whenever I have any change to a specific balance, it should go through all days after it in the same month and deduct the delta from before the change and after the change from the running balance.

IE. \
1/1/2021 - balance 1000\
1/2/2021 - balance 1000\
1/3/2021 - balance 1000\
\
1/1/2021 - balance 1000\
1/2/2021 - balance 1200, income 200, delta = +200\
1/3/2021 - balance = balance + delta
